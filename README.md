## Business Problem

Olist is Brazil's largest e-commerce marketplace, connecting independent sellers to customers through a single contract. Analysis of 99,441 orders placed between September 2016 and August 2018 reveals that 97.19% of customers never placed a second order. This is not a data anomaly — it is a structural failure in post-purchase customer lifecycle management that directly suppresses lifetime value and long-term revenue growth.

This project identifies the measurable behavioural, logistical, and categorical drivers of this single-purchase pattern and translates them into prioritised, actionable retention recommendations with estimated revenue impact.

**Core Business Question**

> Why do 97.19% of Olist customers place exactly one order and never return, and which measurable factors most strongly predict this behaviour?

**Decision Supported**

> Where Olist's Chief Commercial Officer (CCO) and Head of Customer Success should allocate retention investment — whether in promotional programme design, customer segmentation-based outreach, category-specific interventions, or geographic piloting strategy.

## Dataset

| Attribute | Details |
|---|---|
| **Source Name** | Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist |
| **Direct Access Link** | https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce |
| **Row Count** | 99,441 orders (raw) → 105,000 rows (stratified processed sample) |
| **Column Count** | 7 raw files · 19 analytical columns in processed master file |
| **Time Period Covered** | September 2016 to August 2018 (23 months) |
| **Format** | CSV (7 relational files) |

**Key Columns Used**

| Column Name | Description | Role in Analysis |
|---|---|---|
| `customer_unique_id` | Canonical real-customer identifier. One real customer can appear under multiple `customer_id` values across orders. Churn is defined at this level — not `customer_id`. | Churn label engineering, all customer-level KPIs |
| `order_purchase_timestamp` | Date and time the customer placed the order | Time-series analysis, days_to_deliver engineering |
| `order_delivered_customer_date` / `order_estimated_delivery_date` | Actual and estimated delivery dates | `delivery_delay_days` computation, logistics KPIs |
| `review_score` | 1–5 customer satisfaction rating (772 orders have no review) | EDA, statistical analysis, Tableau filter dimension |
| `payment_type` | Payment method: credit_card, boleto, voucher, debit_card | Retention segmentation, repeat rate analysis |
| `product_category_name_english` | English translation of product category | Revenue segmentation, category-level churn analysis |
| `churn` | Engineered target: 1 = one order (churned), 0 = two or more orders (retained) | Primary analytical target across all notebooks and dashboard |
| `delivery_delay_days` | Engineered: actual minus estimated delivery in days. Negative = early | Logistics performance KPI, churn driver analysis |
| `order_revenue` | Engineered: price + freight_value | Revenue KPIs, spend segmentation, LTV modelling |

For full column definitions, see [`docs/data_dictionary.md`](docs/data_dictionary.md).

## KPI Framework

| KPI | Definition | Formula / Computation |
|---|---|---|
| Overall Churn Rate | % of unique customers who placed exactly one order | `(churned customers / total unique customers) × 100` — NB05 |
| Repeat Customer Rate | % of unique customers who placed 2+ orders | `100 - Churn Rate` — NB05 |
| Total Revenue (R$) | Sum of all order revenue across the dataset | `SUM(order_revenue)` — NB05 |
| Avg Order Value | Mean revenue per order line | `MEAN(order_revenue)` — NB05 |
| On-Time Delivery Rate | % of orders delivered on or before the estimated date | `(delivery_delay_days <= 0).mean() × 100` — NB05 |
| Avg Delivery Delay | Mean delivery_delay_days across all delivered orders | `MEAN(delivery_delay_days)` — NB05 |
| Avg Days to Deliver | Mean actual wait time from order placement to delivery | `MEAN(days_to_deliver)` — NB05 |
| Avg Review Score | Mean review score across all orders with a review | `MEAN(review_score)` — NB05 |
| Voucher Repeat Rate | Repeat rate specifically for customers who paid by voucher | Computed in NB03 and Tableau |
| High-Value Customer % | % of customers in the top spend segment | Computed in NB05 customers_kpi.csv |

Document KPI logic clearly in `notebooks/04_statistical_analysis.ipynb` and `notebooks/05_final_load_prep.ipynb`.

## Key Insights

1. **97.19% of Olist customers buy once and never return.** This is not category-specific or regional — it is a platform-wide structural failure in post-purchase re-engagement. A lifecycle programme is the only fix.
2. **Delivery performance is strong and is not the primary cause of churn.** 92.9% of orders arrive before the estimated delivery date, with a mean of 12 days ahead of expectation. Improving logistics SLA further will not meaningfully change the churn rate.
3. **Voucher users retain at nearly double the platform average.** Voucher users repeat at 5.86% versus the platform average of 2.81% — the single strongest retention signal in the data. Promotional instruments are already the most effective retention mechanism on the platform.
4. **High-spend customers churn 5.5 percentage points less than low-spend customers.** High-spend segment: 91.78% churn vs 97.26% for low-spend. They represent only 0.08% of the base but generate disproportionate revenue.
5. **Spend compounds with order count.** Average spend per order rises from R$ 141 for 1-order customers to R$ 940 for 4-order customers. Each additional order is worth dramatically more than the last.
6. **Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Minas Gerais represent 66.7% of all orders.** These three states are the platform's commercial core and the ideal pilot location for any retention programme.
7. **Northern Brazil faces structural logistics disadvantages.** States like AP, RR, and AM have delivery times of 24–28 days versus a national average of 12 days — a separate retention problem driven by logistics friction.
8. **Health & Beauty and Watches & Gifts are the highest-revenue categories but not natural repeat-purchase categories.** High-consideration purchases with long inter-purchase cycles explain part of the structural churn.
9. **No single variable is a strong independent predictor of churn.** Logistic regression and effect size analysis confirm all tested features have negligible effect sizes (Cohen's d < 0.04, Cramer's V < 0.05). Churn is structural, not feature-driven.
10. **Customers who leave any review — even negative — show marginally higher retention.** The No Review segment has the lowest churn rate (93.75%), suggesting any post-purchase interaction correlates with slightly higher re-engagement likelihood.

## Recommendations

| # | Insight | Recommendation | Expected Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Voucher users repeat at 5.86% — double the platform average | Deploy automated post-purchase voucher (10–15% discount) to all first-time customers within 7 days of delivery | +1,900 repeat customers → ~R$ 325,000 incremental revenue |
| 2 | High-spend customers churn 5.5 pp less than low-spend | Enrol customers spending R$ 500+ in first order into a VIP loyalty tier with free express shipping and priority support | +200 repeat customers → ~R$ 170,000 |
| 3 | 1–2 star reviews are a leading indicator of disengagement | Auto-trigger personalised apology + R$ 20 credit within 48 hours of a low review submission | +2,400 recovered customers → ~R$ 410,000 |
| 4 | Health & Beauty is top revenue but low natural repeat category | Smart reminder programme 60–90 days post-purchase for consumable categories (Health & Beauty, Bed & Bath, Housewares) | +950 additional orders → ~R$ 132,000 |
| 5 | SP, RJ, MG = 66.7% of all orders with the strongest logistics | Pilot all retention programmes in these 3 states first before national rollout | Statistical validation in 6 weeks · n > 18,000 · unlocks full national scale |

**Combined estimated impact: ~R$ 1.04M in recoverable incremental revenue — approximately 7.1% of total dataset revenue of R$ 14.69M.**

1. **Define** — Sector selected (E-Commerce), problem statement scoped around customer churn, mentor approval obtained.
2. **Extract** — 7 raw Olist CSV files sourced from Kaggle and committed to `data/raw/`; data dictionary drafted in `docs/`.
3. **Clean and Transform** — Cleaning pipeline built in `notebooks/02_cleaning.ipynb` using `scripts/etl_pipeline.py`. Key steps: timestamp parsing, delivered-only filter, 6-table merge, churn label engineering, stratified sample to 105,000 rows.
4. **Analyze** — EDA in NB03 (churn distribution, geo, revenue, delivery, reviews) and statistical analysis in NB04 (T-test, Mann-Whitney U, Cohen's d, Chi-square, Cramer's V, VIF, logistic regression).
5. **Visualize** — Interactive Tableau dashboard built and published on Tableau Public. 3 pages, 5 filter dimensions, 3 dashboard screenshots committed to `tableau/screenshots/`.
6. **Recommend** — 5 data-backed business recommendations delivered, each linked to a quantified insight with estimated revenue impact.
